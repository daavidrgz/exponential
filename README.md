## About Me

Hi üëãüèª! I was born in Galicia, Spain, and I studied Computer Science at the University of A Coru√±a. Graduated with honors and ranking among the best students across different universities in Galicia. Now I spend my (professional) time building
the new cutting-edge AI Assistant for Inditex and my (personal) time contributing to interesting open-source projects. From time to time I love playing the guitar and the piano (as certified professional musician) and I'm a huge football fan.
